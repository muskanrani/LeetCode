You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r

#Solution

class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder res = new StringBuilder();
        int i =0;
        while(i<word1.length() || i< word2.length()){
            if(i<word1.length()){
                res.append(word1.charAt(i));
            }
            if(i<word2.length()){
                res.append(word2.charAt(i));
            }
            i++;
        }
        return res.toString();
    }
}
