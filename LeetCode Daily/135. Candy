There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

 

Example 1:

Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
 

Constraints:

n == ratings.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104

#Solution

class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int n = ratings.length;
        if(n <2){
            return 1;
        }
        int[] left = new int[n];
        int[] right = new int[n];
        int res = 0;
        Arrays.fill(left,1);
        Arrays.fill(right,1);
        for(int i=1; i<n;i++){
            if(ratings[i]>ratings[i-1]){
                left[i] = left[i-1]+1;
            }
        }
        for(int j = n-2;j>=0;j--){
            if(ratings[j]>ratings[j+1]){
                right[j] = right[j+1]+1;
            }
        }
        for(int k=0;k<n;k++){
            res += Math.max(left[k],right[k]);
        }
        return res;
    }
}


#Solution 2 using single array
